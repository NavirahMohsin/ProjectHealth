                    Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is a potentially fatal
                    bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Clostridium
                    tetani. The bacteria are commonly found in soil, dust, and
                    animal feces and can enter the body through wounds or breaks
                    in the skin, including cuts, puncture wounds, burns, and
                    surgical wounds.

                    <span>Causes and Symptoms</span>
                  </p>
                  <p class="causes-the-bacteria">
                    Causes: The bacteria produce a toxin called tetanospasmin,
                    which affects the nervous system, leading to muscle
                    stiffness and spasms. The toxin travels through the nerves
                    to the spinal cord and brain, where it interferes with the
                    normal functioning of inhibitory neurons, causing
                    overstimulation of muscles. This results in muscle rigidity
                    and painful muscle contractions, most commonly starting in
                    the jaw and neck (hence the name "lockjaw") but can spread
                    to other parts of the body.

                  <p class="symptoms-symptoms-of">
                    symptoms: Symptoms of tetanus typically develop within a few
                    days to several weeks after infection, depending on factors
                    such as the location and severity of the wound. Early
                    symptoms may include muscle stiffness and spasms, difficulty
                    swallowing, stiffness of the jaw muscles (trismus), and
                    muscle pain. As the infection progresses, muscle spasms can
                    become severe and may lead to complications such as
                    fractures, respiratory problems, and even death if untreated
                    The severity of tetanus depends on various factors,
                    including the amount of toxin produced, the site of the
                    wound, and the individual's immune response. Tetanus can be
                    particularly dangerous in unvaccinated individuals, as well
                    as in newborns born to mothers who are not vaccinated
                    against tetanus.

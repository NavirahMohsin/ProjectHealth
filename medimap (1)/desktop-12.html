              Causes: Leptospirosis is more common in tropical and subtropical
              regions, especially in areas with warm and humid climates where
              there is frequent flooding or standing water. Occupational
              exposure, such as farming, fishing, and military activities, can

              symptoms: The symptoms of leptospirosis can vary widely, ranging
              from mild flu-like symptoms to severe manifestations. In some
              cases, the infection may cause no symptoms at all (asymptomatic),
              or the symptoms may be so mild that they go unnoticed. Common
              symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, chills, nausea,
              vomiting, and abdominal pain. In severe cases, leptospirosis can
              lead to jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), kidney failure,
              meningitis (inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain
              and spinal cord), and potentially life-threatening complications
              such as liver failure and pulmonary hemorrhage.

            Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection caused by various species of
            the Leptospira bacteria, particularly Leptospira interrogans. It is
            a zoonotic disease, meaning it primarily affects animals but can
            also be transmitted to humans, typically through exposure to water
            or soil contaminated with the urine of infected animals, such as
            rodents, livestock, and dogs.

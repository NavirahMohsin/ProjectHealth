              Rabies is a viral disease that affects the central nervous system
              (CNS), caused by the rabies virus, which belongs to the Lyssavirus
              genus. It is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite or
              scratch of an infected animal, most commonly dogs. The virus is
              typically present in the saliva of infected animals and can enter
              the body through broken skin.

              Causes: It is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite or

              Once the rabies virus enters the body, it travels along peripheral
              nerves to the brain and spinal cord. The incubation period, the
              time from exposure to the onset of symptoms, can vary widely,
              ranging from a few days to several years, although it typically
              ranges from one to three months.

                  non-specific symptoms such as fever, headache, malaise, and
                  discomfort at the site of the bite or scratch. There may also
                  be tingling or numbness around the wound site. This stage

                  (fear of water), difficulty swallowing, and paralysis. This
                  stage is often fatal, with death typically occurring within a
                  few days to weeks after the onset of symptoms, usually due to
                  respiratory failure.</span
